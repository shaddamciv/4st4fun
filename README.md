# AIccountability

On-chain AI accountability partner that rewards users for completing tasks and staying on track with their goals

AIccountability is an agent that helps users stay on track with their personal goals and tasks. It provides a means to track progress and offer incentives. The AI analyzes the user's tasks, schedules, and behavior patterns, offering tailored reminders, motivational support, and real-time feedback to maximize productivity.

When users complete tasks, the AI rewards them with ACC tokens that can be used within the ecosystem or exchanged on a DEX. The more consistently users meet their objectives, the greater their rewards. Additionally, users can set up challenge milestones, receive periodic progress reports, and even participate in a community-driven leaderboard to foster healthy competition and motivation.

All interactions, rewards, and progress reports are stored securely and transparently, making the entire process verifiable and tamper-proof. Whether the goal is related to fitness, productivity, learning, or personal development, AIccountability ensures users are motivated with real-time incentives, empowering them to achieve more and grow their digital asset portfolio simultaneously.

The project has been bootstrapped with the Eliza starter kit. We made use of the telegram client to enable communication via Telegram.
The reward token is developed using Arbitrum Stylus, and is deployed on the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.
We utilized a custom ERC20 plugin in order to facilitate transfers from the agent.
